Position and velocity control of a dc motor linear actuator using pid control 
the values of pid are reached after building the model on via MATLAB and appling various control methods (root locus , )to reach the optimum values to maintain minumal steady state error and fastest response 
the actuator can carry up to 10 kg and move with a velocity up to 65cm/sec
