a propotional and sequention control over a prosthetic finger using readings from EMG sensor to control a servo motor
EMG sensor readings is very noisy so filter was applied and RMS value for the reading was taken.

a novelty i believe was created in the way we took the EMG sensor readings to reduce the noise and
also to disregard unwanted change in the readings due to diffrent circumstances.
